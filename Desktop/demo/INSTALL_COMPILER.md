# C++ Compiler Installation Guide for Windows

## 🎯 Quick Solution

To build the Secure Communication Protocol, you need a C++ compiler. Here are the options:

### Option 1: Visual Studio Build Tools (Recommended)
```powershell
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools

# After installation, run from Developer Command Prompt:
# Start Menu -> Visual Studio 2022 -> Developer Command Prompt
# Then navigate to your project and run: .\build.bat
```

### Option 2: MinGW-w64 (Alternative)
```powershell
# Download from: https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/
